    <h1>Welcome to the forest!</h1>
    <p>The Forest is a place where you can hunt and collect bugs from the Sapherna forest. All you need is an avatar, a net, and some energy to hunt! Bugs can be sold in exchange for Ores, so it's also a great way to work toward an item you want. Again, welcome to the forest and happy hunting!</p>
